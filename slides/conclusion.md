# Conclusion

## State machine testing

- Very powerful technique to test stateful systems.
- App being tested doesn't have to use Haskell or FP.

## `NixOps`

- Referentially transparent specification of a deployment.
- Deploy in a few commands.

## `DMap`

- Heterogenous mapping of keys to values that preserves type safety.
- Good for more "dynamic" APIs and loose specs.

## `servant`

- Declare your API as a type and get client functions for free.
- Allows us to extend it's API language as necessary.

##

Go forth and test!
