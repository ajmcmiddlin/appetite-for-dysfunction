# Structure

- What and why.
- Quick overvie of state machine testing + example output.
- `nixops` to get a WordPress instance.
- `servant` to specify the WordPress API.
- `dependent-map` to deal with dynamic JSON without sacrificing type safety.
- Take away
   + Some good tools that might not be well known
   + Writing these tests really shake out how an API works
   + You really feel the pain of a poor (by my definition) API when you work with it in Haskell.

# What and why?

- Why I'm giving this talk.
   + State machine testing an application not written in Haskell --- something dynamic and challenging.
   + Presented some interesting problems
